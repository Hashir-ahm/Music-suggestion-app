Implementation of spotify recomendation system

1. Introduction:
This report outlines the process of building a music recommendation system utilizing various technologies including Python, MongoDB, Apache Spark, and collaborative filtering algorithm (ALS). The system involves extracting necessary columns from a dataset, calculating MFCC features, storing them in MongoDB, processing data using Spark, applying the ALS algorithm to generate top 5 suggested songs, sending recommendations to consumers, and finally storing the recommendations in a text file.

2. Data Preparation:
The first step involves data preprocessing where we extract necessary columns from the dataset. This could include attributes such as song title, artist, genre, and audio features.

3. Feature Extraction:
Next, we compute Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) from the audio data. MFCCs are widely used in speech and audio processing tasks for their effectiveness in capturing the characteristics of audio signals.

4. Data Storage:
We utilize MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store the calculated MFCC features. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability make it suitable for storing large volumes of unstructured data such as audio features.

5. Data Processing with Spark:
Apache Spark is employed for data processing due to its ability to handle large-scale data processing tasks efficiently. We use Spark to retrieve data from MongoDB and create a DataFrame for further analysis.

6. Collaborative Filtering with ALS Algorithm:
Collaborative filtering is a popular technique for building recommendation systems. We apply the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm, available in Spark's MLlib library, to generate personalized song recommendations based on user preferences.

7. Recommendation Generation:
Using the ALS model, we generate the top 5 suggested songs for each user based on their listening history or preferences.

8. Sending Recommendations to Consumers:
The recommended songs are then sent to consumers via their preferred communication channels, such as email, SMS, or push notifications, to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

9. Storing Recommendations:
Finally, the recommended songs are stored in a text file for further analysis or archival purposes. This text file can serve as a record of past recommendations and aid in evaluating the performance of the recommendation system over time.

10. Conclusion:
In conclusion, the implemented music recommendation system effectively leverages data processing technologies such as MongoDB and Apache Spark, along with machine learning algorithms like ALS, to provide personalized song recommendations to users. By combining various components seamlessly, the system offers a scalable and efficient solution for music recommendation tasks.
